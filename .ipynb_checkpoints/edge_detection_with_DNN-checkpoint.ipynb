    "### Holistically-nested edge detection (HED)\n",
    "- detecting edges and object boundaries in natural images is a long-standing vision problem\n",
    "- methods of different types\n",
    "  - early pioneering methods, for example, sobel detector, zero-crossing, Canny\n",
    "  - methods driven by information theory, for example, Statistical Edges, Pb, gPb\n",
    "  - learning based methods, for example, BEL, multi-scale, sketch tokens, structured edges （SE， high performance and speed）\n",
    "  - With deep neural networks, N4-fields, deep contour, deepedge, CSCNN\n",
    "- solved two issues\n",
    "  - holistic image training and prediction (this is where holistically come from, imaged-to-image fashion)\n",
    "  - multi-scale and mutli-level feature learning (this is where nested come from, deep layer supervision to guide early classification results)\n",
    "- HED structure\n",
    "  - inspired by fully convolutional neural networks (FCN), and deeply-supervised nets (DSN).\n",
    "  - based on VGG Net, connect side output layer to the last convolutional layer in each stage, conv12, conv22, conv33, conv43, conv53\n",
    "  - pretrained on imagenet, supervised on each side output layer, \n",
    "  - deep supervision\n",
    "  - interpolating the side outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- dataset\n",
    "  - Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark, BSDS500\n",
    "  - NYU Depth Dataset, NYUD, 1449 RGB-D images, 381 training, 414 validation, and 654 testing\n",
    "    - Depth is embeded into three channels, HHA. Run two models on RGB and HHA separately, then average the results.\n",
    "- Performance Measurement\n",
    "  - fixed contour threshold, ODS\n",
    "  - per-image best threshold, OIS\n",
    "  - average precision, AP\n",
    "  - F-score\n",
    "  - frames per seconds, FPS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Misc\n",
    "  - deeply-supervised nets, integrates direct supervision to the hidden layers rather than the standard approach of providing supervision only at the output layer"
